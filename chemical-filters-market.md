<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Activated Carbon Filters</li><li>Ion-exchange Resin Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chemical filters market includes activated carbon filters and ion-exchange resin filters, each serving distinct purposes. Activated carbon filters effectively adsorb impurities, odors, and pollutants from air and water due to their porous structure, making them ideal for a range of applications, including air purification and drinking water treatment. Ion-exchange resin filters, on the other hand, facilitate the removal of ionic impurities by exchanging harmful ions with less harmful ones, commonly used in water softening and demineralization processes. Both types are essential for ensuring clean and safe environments.</p></p>
