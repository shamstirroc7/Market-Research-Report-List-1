<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UHT (ultra-high temperature) Processing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The UHT (ultra-high temperature) processing market consists of two primary types: direct and indirect. Direct UHT processing involves swiftly heating the product by injecting steam, resulting in immediate sterilization and retention of flavor. Conversely, indirect UHT processing utilizes heat exchangers to transfer energy to the product without direct contact with steam, which helps preserve taste while ensuring sterility. Both methods effectively extend shelf life, targeting dairy, juice, and other liquid food industries.</p></p>
