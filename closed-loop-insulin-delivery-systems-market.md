<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Tube</li><li>Tubeless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Closed-loop insulin delivery systems are advanced technologies that automate insulin administration for diabetes management. They are categorized into two main types: tube-based and tubeless systems. Tube-based systems connect an insulin pump to a catheter, providing continuous insulin delivery with precise monitoring. In contrast, tubeless systems, often resembling patch pumps, deliver insulin without external tubing, offering greater convenience and mobility. Both types aim to improve glycemic control while enhancing user experience and lifestyle flexibility for individuals with diabetes.</p></p>
