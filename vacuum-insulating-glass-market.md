<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Insulating Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tempered VIG</li><li>Non-tempered VIG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vacuum Insulating Glass (VIG) market is divided into two main types: tempered VIG and non-tempered VIG. Tempered VIG undergoes heat treatment, enhancing its strength and thermal resistance, making it suitable for high-stress applications such as facades and skylights. Non-tempered VIG, while generally more cost-effective and easier to produce, offers less strength and is better suited for less demanding applications. Both types are designed to improve energy efficiency and provide superior insulation compared to traditional glazing options.</p></p>
