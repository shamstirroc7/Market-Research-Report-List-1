<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ethylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ethane</li><li>Naphtha</li><li>LPG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ethylene market is primarily categorized into three feedstock types: ethane, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Ethane is a natural gas byproduct, favored for its high ethylene yield and cost-effectiveness in steam cracking processes. Naphtha, a heavier hydrocarbon derived from crude oil, is versatile but more expensive, often used in regions lacking sufficient ethane supply. LPG, comprising propane and butane, serves as an alternative feedstock, offering flexibility in operations, though it typically has lower yield compared to ethane and naphtha.</p></p>
