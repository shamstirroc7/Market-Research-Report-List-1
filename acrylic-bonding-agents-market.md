<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Re-Emulsifiable</li><li>Not Re-Emulsifiable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acrylic bonding agents are crucial in construction and renovation, classified into two main types: re-emulsifiable and not re-emulsifiable. Re-emulsifiable bonding agents can be re-dispersed in water after drying, allowing for easy repairs and modifications. They are often used in applications like patching and resurfacing. Conversely, not re-emulsifiable bonding agents form a permanent bond and cannot be re-dispersed once cured, making them ideal for high-stress applications where durability and stability are essential. Each type serves distinct purposes based on project requirements.</p></p>
